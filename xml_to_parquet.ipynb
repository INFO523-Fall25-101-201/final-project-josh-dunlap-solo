Shortly after, other riders came in, confirming this statement. Our people were ails incredulous, but to do wh^t we could, the Court-house bell was rung, and the Horue Guards, about one hundred in all, turned out.

The Railroad Company lost three locomotives, and a large amount of valuable and costly tools. Before firing WIJ:IbBBLtCB, SaeD ac Co.\\'s warehouse, they rifted it of several ho:es or muskets, revolvers, sabres, doe., stored there by the United States officers, after which it was fired. It was feared that the immense quantity of ammunition would prove disastrous to the town. The rebels went to the houses in the vicinity, and sent the occupants away. Fortunately the ammunition exploded gradually as it became heated. With two exceptions no person was injured by the exploding shells. A stable attached to the hotel of Mr. GExt was burned about two hours after the departure of the rebels, whether by a spark from the burning , or by a slow match from some of the infernal scamps, is not known. The loss of the Railroad Company is es timated at about $10,000. Rlessrs. Wosnxat.tcg, Saen dz Co.\\'a lose is about ,000. The , when captured, vas estimated at about $ZOO,000, but it was since said to be worthless. In another large warehouse near the one burned was stored a large amount of ammunition, which the did not discover. In the evening previous to the arrival of our unex peeled visitors a train of Government stores arrived and was suffered to remain, although several engines were run doa n the road, to prevent their destruction. The contents of these cars, consisting of ng, hats, caps, shoes, d;c., dec., were all car tied off by the rebels. \\'this plunder doubtless saved our stores the rebels getting as much as they could carry with them. Faithful to their promise, no private property wss , except such as was contraband o` war, or had been used for Government purposes. We may safely estimate that I,000 valuable horses were taken from our county. We would value them at an aggregate of $80,000. Grain, fences, &.c., destroyed in their route, $20,000. The result of this raid is the capture and destroying of property of not less than $800,000 in value. We think our military authorities were caught napping. The danger of a raid in this very way was feared and spoken o!. Twenty hours after the departure of the rebels troops arrived, but the Lirds had Rown. II.'"
