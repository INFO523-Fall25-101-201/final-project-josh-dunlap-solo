Special to The New York Times.                 RICHMOND, Va., March 2.-The drawing of pistols and a fight between a member of the Legislature and a Norfolk lawyer enlivened a meeting of the House Committee on Elections in the Legislature this | morning. In course of an argument by a reform committee from Norfolk for a new registration, S. S. Lambeth made a statement in re- , gard to election frauds in Norfolk which Representative \\ of Norfolk, who was a judge of election in that city, declared was a lie. Lambeth retorted, and Whitehead kicked Lambeth and then hit him. Spectators rushed in, pistols were drawn, and only ihe rush of the crowd prevented more ser ouT results. The Rev. C. I. Stensele of Norfolk, who led the reform delegation, took part in the row. The affair has strengthened the pending bill against carrying or the sale of pistols.                         \n"
